        Tensor of shape ``(n_arms, 2)`` containing the ``(bid, ask)`` arms.
    samples : torch.Tensor
        Tensor containing samples drawn from the latent value distribution.

    Returns
    -------
    payoff : torch.Tensor
        Tensor of shape ``(n_arms, n_arms)``, in double precision. The payoff
        matrix of the column maker is its transpose.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `action_space` is not of shape ``(n_arms, 2)``, or if `epsilon` is

    Notes
    -----
    Writing $A = \min(a_i, a_j)$ for the best ask, $B = \max(b_i, b_j)$ for the
    best bid and $m = (A + B) / 2$, the trader executes against the ask when
    $V > m + \epsilon/2$, against the bid when $V < m - \epsilon/2$, and picks a
    side with a fair coin on the closed band in between. Hence

    .. math::

        u_i = s^{ask}_i \left(
            \mathbb{E}[(A - V) \mathbf{1}\{V > m + \epsilon/2\}]
            + \tfrac12 \mathbb{E}[(A - V) \mathbf{1}\{|V - m| \le \epsilon/2\}]
        \right) + s^{bid}_i \left(
            \mathbb{E}[(V - B) \mathbf{1}\{V < m - \epsilon/2\}]
            + \tfrac12 \mathbb{E}[(V - B) \mathbf{1}\{|V - m| \le \epsilon/2\}]
        \right),

    where the shares $s^{ask}_i$ and $s^{bid}_i$ are the reciprocal of the
    number of makers within `epsilon` of the best price on that side, or zero if
    the row maker is not among them.

    The matrix is exact with respect to the *empirical* distribution of
    `samples`, whose own error with respect to the underlying law is of order
    :math:`\sigma / \sqrt{n}` and is correlated across entries.

    This function is specific to two makers. With more makers the payoff depends
    on the whole profile through the best bid and the best ask, so the exact
    object is a tensor with one axis per maker rather than a matrix.

    """Compute how much each maker gains by best responding to the other.

    Given a product distribution over the joint action space, the exploitability
    of a maker is the increase in expected payoff it obtains by switching to its
    best pure response while the opponent keeps its own mixed strategy. Both
    values are zero if and only if the pair is a mixed Nash equilibrium.

    Parameters
    ----------
    payoff : torch.Tensor
        Payoff matrix of the row maker, of shape ``(n_arms, n_arms)``, as
        returned by :func:`get_expected_payoff_matrix`.
    row_policy : torch.Tensor
        Mixed strategy of the row maker, of shape ``(..., n_arms)``. Leading
        dimensions are treated as a batch.
    col_policy : torch.Tensor
        Mixed strategy of the column maker, of shape ``(..., n_arms)``.

    -------
    row_exploitability : torch.Tensor
        Best-response gain of the row maker, of shape ``(...)``.
    col_exploitability : torch.Tensor
        Best-response gain of the column maker, of shape ``(...)``.
